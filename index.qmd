title: "MS-DIAL5 tutorial"
abstract: MS-DIAL was launched as a universal program for untargeted metabolomics that supports multiple instruments (GC/MS, GC/MS/MS, LC/MS, and LC/MS/MS) and MS vendors (Agilent, Bruker, LECO, Sciex, Shimadzu, Thermo, and Waters). Common data formats such as netCDF (AIA) and mzML, can also be managed in our project. In addition, we released several MSP files including both EI- and MS/MS spectra as a ‘start-up kit’. Moreover, MS-DIAL internally has a version of Fiehn lab’s GC/MS database (oriented by FAME RI index), and in silico retention time- and MS/MS database for LC/MS/MS based lipidomics. The isotope labeled tracking can also be executed in LC/MS project.

## General introduction of MS-DIAL5

The current MS-DIAL program provides a stream pipeline for untargeted metabolomics, lipidomics and proteomics. In this latest version, the user experience has been greatly improved with a new graphical interface and also due to the fact it is no longer necessary to convert raw MS data from different vendor formats into a common ABF format (which is still supported), but the data can now be imported directly (supported file formats and analytical techniques are summarized in Figure 1).

The latest version of MS-DIAL aims to be the most versatile tool for multiomics data analysis and therefore supports direct injection, many separation (GC, LC, CE, SFC), ionization (EI, ESI, MALDI), fragmentation (CID, HCD, ETD, ECD, EIEIO, EID, OAD) and MS/MS (DDA, SWATH, AIF) datasets (which are summarized in Figure 2). In addition, technological advances in fragmentation mechanisms such as electron-impact excitation of ions from organics (EIEIO) have also been taken into account, making it possible to work with these types of data to offer comprehensive structural identification of metabolites, lipids and proteins.

After data processing which includes peak picking, deconvolution, compound identification, and peak alignment, MS-DIAL provides several normalization methods (including LOWESS) and a multivariate analysis by principal component analysis (PCA). Finally, for further analysis by other programs, this program can export your result as table format (for SIMCA-P, MetaboAnalyst, and MetFamily etc.), and as several spectral formats including NIST, MassBank, and Mascot formats for compound identifications by MS-FINDER, CSI:FingerID, CFM-ID, MetFrag, and MetFamily etc. For the parameter explanations including the description of MS-DIAL algorithms, see also 'MS-DIAL mathematics' which can be downloaded at [http://prime.psc.riken.jp/Metabolomics_Software/MS-DIAL/MS-DIAL%20FAQ-vs2.pdf](http://prime.psc.riken.jp/compms/msdial/download/mathematics/MS-DIAL%20FAQ-vs2.pdf){.uri}

### Start up a project of MS-DIAL5

This tutorial demonstrates four projects, (1) GC/MS, (2) LC/MS or LC/MS/MS (DDA: data dependent acquisition), (3) LC/MS/MS (data independent acquisition), and (4) LC-Ion mobility for the explanation of parameters and required files. In this section, three projects are summarized and you will find a minimum requirement for these processes. The details for LC/MS/MS (DIA), LC/MS/MS (DDA), GC/MS, and LC-Ion mobility processing are described in Chapter 2, Chapter 3, Chapter 4, and Chapter 10 respectively.

### Centroid or Profile?

### Database (MSP or Text) for compound identification

#### MSP format for precursor- and MS/MS library

#### Adduct ion format

#### Text format library for retention time and accurate mass search (post identification)

#### MSP format as GC/MS library

#### Alkane- or FAME retention time dictionary for the calculation of retention index
