    "text": "The current MS-DIAL program provides a stream pipeline for untargeted metabolomics, lipidomics and proteomics. In this latest version, the user experience has been greatly improved with a new graphical interface and also due to the fact it is no longer necessary to convert raw MS data from different vendor formats into a common ABF format, but the data can now be imported directly. The current MS-DIAL program supports the pipelines for GC/MS, LC/MS, LC/MS/MS (DDA: data dependent acquisition), and LC/MS/MS (DIA: data independent acquisition (SWATH or All ions)) data sets. In addition, technological advances in fragmentation mechanisms such as electron-impact excitation of ions from organics (EIEIO) have also been taken into account, making it possible to work with these types of data to offer comprehensive structural identification of metabolites, lipids and proteins. After data processing which includes peak picking, deconvolution, compound identification, and peak alignment, MS-DIAL provides several normalization methods (including LOWESS) and a multivariate analysis by principal component analysis (PCA). Finally, for further analysis by other programs, this program can export your result as table format (for SIMCA-P, MetaboAnalyst, and MetFamily etc.), and as several spectral formats including NIST, MassBank, and Mascot formats for compound identifications by MS-FINDER, CSI:FingerID, CFM-ID, MetFrag, and MetFamily etc. For the parameter explanations including the description of MS-DIAL algorithms, see also ‘MS-DIAL mathematics’ which can be downloaded at http://prime.psc.riken.jp/Metabolomics_Software/MS-DIAL/MS-DIAL%20FAQ-vs2.pdf.\n\n\nThis tutorial demonstrates four projects, (1) GC/MS, (2) LC/MS or LC/MS/MS (DDA: data dependent acquisition), (3) LC/MS/MS (data independent acquisition), and (4) LC-Ion mobility for the explanation of parameters and required files. In this section, three projects are summarized and you will find a minimum requirement for these processes. The details for LC/MS/MS (DIA), LC/MS/MS (DDA), GC/MS, and LC-Ion mobility processing are described in Chapter 2, Chapter 3, Chapter 4, and Chapter 10 respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAQ"
