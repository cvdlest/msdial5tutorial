    "text": "The current MS-DIAL program provides a stream pipeline for untargeted metabolomics, lipidomics and proteomics. In this latest version, the user experience has been greatly improved with a new graphical interface and also due to the fact it is no longer necessary to convert raw MS data from different vendor formats into a common ABF format (which is still supported), but the data can now be imported directly (supported file formats and analytical techniques are summarized in Figure 1).\n\n\n\nFigure 1 Overview of supported file formats and analytical techniques\n\n\nThe latest version of MS-DIAL aims to be the most versatile tool for multiomics data analysis and therefore supports direct injection, many separation (GC, LC, CE, SFC), ionization (EI, ESI, MALDI), fragmentation (CID, HCD, ETD, ECD, EIEIO, EID, OAD) and MS/MS (DDA, SWATH, AIF) datasets (which are summarized in Figure 2). In addition, technological advances in fragmentation mechanisms such as electron-impact excitation of ions from organics (EIEIO) have also been taken into account, making it possible to work with these types of data to offer comprehensive structural identification of metabolites, lipids and proteins.\n\n\n\nFigure 2 Summary of analytical techniques compatible with MS-DIAL 5\n\n\nAfter data processing which includes peak picking, deconvolution, compound identification, and peak alignment, MS-DIAL provides several normalization methods (including LOWESS) and a multivariate analysis by principal component analysis (PCA). Finally, for further analysis by other programs, this program can export your result as table format (for SIMCA-P, MetaboAnalyst, and MetFamily etc.), and as several spectral formats including NIST, MassBank, and Mascot formats for compound identifications by MS-FINDER, CSI:FingerID, CFM-ID, MetFrag, and MetFamily etc. For the parameter explanations including the description of MS-DIAL algorithms, see also ‘MS-DIAL mathematics’ which can be downloaded at http://prime.psc.riken.jp/Metabolomics_Software/MS-DIAL/MS-DIAL%20FAQ-vs2.pdf\n\n\nThis tutorial demonstrates four projects, (1) GC/MS, (2) LC/MS or LC/MS/MS (DDA: data dependent acquisition), (3) LC/MS/MS (data independent acquisition), and (4) LC-Ion mobility for the explanation of parameters and required files. In this section, three projects are summarized and you will find a minimum requirement for these processes. The details for LC/MS/MS (DIA), LC/MS/MS (DDA), GC/MS, and LC-Ion mobility processing are described in Chapter 2, Chapter 3, Chapter 4, and Chapter 10 respectively. First you need to start a new project in MS-DIAL5, set up a folder to store your project files and point MS-DIAL5 to the folder where your raw data is stored (Figure 3).\n\n\n\nFigure 3 Startup a project in MS-DIAL5. First select new project to be created (1), next select a location where your project files will be saved (2). You need to direct MS-DIAL5 to your raw data file location (3) and select the corresponding data file format in the scrolling selection list and select the data files you want to process (4).\n\n\nAfter inserting your raw data files, you will be able to further assign identifiers to your measurements by sample type (Sample, Standard, QC, Blank), class ID (according to your experimental setup), and you can also set the batch (if you analyzed multiple batches), analytical order, dilution factor, or possibly exclude some samples from further data processing (Figure 4).\n\n\n\nFigure 4 Specifications of raw measurement files. An example of assigning identifiers to your raw measurement files (more details will be described in the following sections).\n\n\nAfter assigning identifiers to the raw measurement files, click “Next” to go to the “Measurement parameters” tab. Here you will need to enter the analytical and instrumental parameters that were used to acquire your data (Figure 5).\n\n\n\nFigure 5 Measurement parameters. Overview of the paramaters that need to be set according to your analytical and instrumental setup.\n\n\nThe following sections will contain information about the data type (centroid and profile), the data format of custom user database (MSP file), and information about the types of adducts. The next chapters will then demonstrate case studies of processing different types of publicly available data in MS-DIAL5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFAQ"
